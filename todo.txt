1. We can add HTTPS, but because we are using a "Kind" cluster on your own server (to save costs), it's a bit involved.

⚠️ The Trade-off
To enable HTTPS (Port 443), we must delete and re-create your Kubernetes cluster.

Why? The current configuration only mapped specific ports (3000, 8000). We need to map standard web ports (80, 443) at the cluster creation time.
Data Loss? Your MongoDB is in the cloud (Atlas), so No Data Loss. But we will need to re-run the deployment commands (about 10 mins of work).
The Plan
Start the Server (You stopped it).
Delete Cluster (kind delete cluster).
Update Config to expose ports 80 & 443.
Create Cluster again.
Install Ingress Controller & Cert-Manager (Tools that handle the certificates automatically).
Do you want to proceed with this? (It will take about 15-20 mins).
